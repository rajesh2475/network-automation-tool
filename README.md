### Overview

This project provides two different approaches to automate network device configuration:

### Using Paramiko (Python): 
Establishes an SSH connection to network devices, executes configuration commands, and validates the configuration.

### Using Ansible: 
Uses Ansible playbooks to configure network devices and validate the setup.
